# EVE ESI Skill for OpenClaw

> Ask your agent what New Eden is up to — wallet, skills, industry, and what
> your planets are doing while you are docked somewhere else entirely.

An [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) skill for the
[EVE Online ESI API](https://developers.eveonline.com/api-explorer)
(EVE Swagger Interface). Read-only by default, no pip dependencies, tokens
stay on your machine.

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Authentication** | EVE SSO OAuth2 with PKCE, no client secret. Tokens auto-refresh and rotate. |
| **Multi-character** | Unlimited characters under named keys — `main`, `alt1`, whatever you call them. |
| **Planetary Interaction** | Extractor timers, storage fill, factory routing, and a parsed "needs attention" verdict per planet. |
| **Market** | Global adjusted/average prices, plus live Jita buy/sell for a single type. |
| **Threat assessment** | System scoring from ESI kills and jumps combined with zKillboard PVP data. |
| **Route planning** | Routes annotated with a per-system threat level. |
| **ESI queries** | Generic helper with pagination, rate-limit handling and error recovery. |
| **Dashboard config** | A validated JSON Schema vocabulary for alerts, reports and price tracking. Defines them; does not run them. |

## Install

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills
git clone https://github.com/burnshall-ui/openclaw-eve-skill eve-esi
```

Python 3.8+, standard library only for everything in this repo.

## Authenticate

**Before you start**, register an application at
[developers.eveonline.com](https://developers.eveonline.com/applications):

1. Callback URL: `http://localhost:8080/callback`. The portal accepts the `http`
   scheme only for the host `localhost` — `127.0.0.1` is refused on save.
2. Enable the scopes you may want under **Enabled Scopes**. A scope profile can
   only ask for what the application already has enabled, so enabling a scope
   here does not grant it — it just makes it available to request. Planetary
   Interaction needs `esi-planets.manage_planets.v1`; to keep `--scope-profile
   full` usable later, enable all 17 listed under [Scope profiles](#scope-profiles).
3. Note the **Client ID** (with PKCE there is no client secret to keep)

Then authenticate once per character:

```bash
# On a remote server, tunnel the callback port to your browser first:
ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 user@your-server -N

python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --client-id <YOUR_CLIENT_ID> --char-name main
# Open the printed URL and log in with your EVE account
```

**Choose how much access to grant.** Scopes are granted once and stay granted
until you revoke them, so the default asks for the narrow set:

| Profile | Scopes | Grants access to |
|---|---|---|
| `basic` | 7 | Skills, skill queue, clones, implants, location, ship, online status |
| `pi` **(default)** | 8 | `basic` plus Planetary Interaction |
| `industry` | 11 | `basic` plus assets, industry jobs, market orders, contracts |
| `full` | 17 | Everything, **including wallet balance, ISK history and mail** |

```bash
python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --list-scope-profiles          # exact scopes per profile
python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --client-id <ID> --scope-profile full
python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --client-id <ID> --scopes "esi-skills.read_skills.v1"
```

The flow prints what it is about to request before opening the browser, and EVE
SSO shows you the same list on its consent screen. Nothing is granted until you
approve it there.

Tokens land in `~/.openclaw/eve-tokens.json` (`chmod 600`) and rotate on every
use. Repeat with a different `--char-name` for each alt:

```bash
python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --client-id <CLIENT_ID> --char-name alt1
python3 scripts/get_token.py --list      # who is authenticated?
```

## Quick start

`--char <name>` resolves and refreshes the token **in-process**, so it never
touches a command line, your shell history, or a log file. Prefer it over
passing `--token`.

```bash
SKILL=~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/eve-esi
CHAR_ID=<your_character_id>

# Wallet balance
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --char main \
  --endpoint "/characters/$CHAR_ID/wallet/" --pretty

# Skill queue
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --char main \
  --endpoint "/characters/$CHAR_ID/skillqueue/" --pretty

# Every asset you own, following pagination
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --char main \
  --endpoint "/characters/$CHAR_ID/assets/" --pages --pretty

# Planets, and what needs attention on them
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action pi_planets --char main --character-id $CHAR_ID --pretty
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action pi_status  --char main --character-id $CHAR_ID --pretty

# Market — public data, no authentication needed
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action jita_price --type-id 2393 --pretty
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action market_price_bulk --pretty
```

## Planetary Interaction

High-level actions that turn raw ESI output into something you can act on.

```bash
# All planets for a character
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action pi_planets \
  --char main --character-id $CHAR_ID --pretty

# Extractor timers, storage fill, attention flags
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action pi_status \
  --char main --character-id $CHAR_ID --pretty

# One planet in detail
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action pi_planet_detail \
  --char main --character-id $CHAR_ID --planet-id <PLANET_ID> --pretty
```

`pi_status` returns per planet:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `planet_name` | Resolved planet name (e.g. "Ikoskio VII") |
| `extractors` | Product, expiry time, hours remaining, status |
| `storage_fill_pct` | Estimated launchpad/storage fill |
| `factories` | Input/output product routing |
| `needs_attention` | `true` when an extractor runs dry in < 6 h or storage exceeds 80 % |
| `action_required` | Plain-language description of what to do |

**A limit worth knowing up front:** ESI exposes PI as **read-only**. This skill
will tell you that an extractor expires in four hours and that your launchpad
is nearly full — it cannot restart the extractor, reroute a product, or touch
the layout. That part still happens in the client.

## Market prices

```bash
# Adjusted and average prices for every type in the game
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action market_price_bulk --pretty

# Live Jita book for one type (9832 = Coolant)
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action jita_price --type-id 9832 --pretty
```

`jita_price` reports lowest sell, highest buy, the spread and order counts for
The Forge.

## Threat assessment and route planning

Intended for deciding whether that low-sec PI run is worth it right now.

```bash
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action system_kills --system-ids 30002537 --pretty
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action system_jumps --system-ids 30002537 --pretty
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action system_info  --system-id 30002537 --pretty

python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action route_plan \
  --origin 30000142 --destination 30002537 --route-flag secure --pretty

python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action character_location \
  --char main --character-id $CHAR_ID --pretty

python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action fw_systems --pretty
python3 $SKILL/scripts/esi_query.py --action incursions --pretty
```

**Threat levels**

| Level | Score | Read as |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | 0–15 | Normal operations |
| `medium` | 15–40 | Quick in, quick out |
| `high` | 40–80 | Scout or cloak only |
| `critical` | 80+ | Do not enter |

**Data sources** — all public, none require authentication:

| Source | Data |
|---|---|
| ESI `/universe/system_kills/` | Ship, pod and NPC kills, last hour |
| ESI `/universe/system_jumps/` | Jump traffic, last hour |
| ESI `/route/{origin}/{destination}/` | Route planning |
| ESI `/fw/systems/` | Faction Warfare contested systems |
| ESI `/incursions/` | Active NPC incursions |
| zKillboard API | PVP kills with value, last 24 h |

The raw data above is what this skill provides, and the `--action` helpers for
it work today. The composite *scoring* layer on top — `threat_query.py`,
`cache_threat_data.py` — is **not written yet**: `SKILL.md` describes the
interface it should have, as a specification for something you build in your
agent workspace. Nothing named there ships with this repo.

## Dashboard config

**What ships here is the config format and its validator — not a runner.** The
skill has no poller, no scheduler and no code that sends a message anywhere;
`grep` it for yourself. The tables below are the vocabulary your agent's own
automation can use, and the validator tells you whether a config is well formed
and whether your token covers the scopes it asks for. Wiring it to something
that actually polls on a schedule and delivers to Telegram or Discord is work
that lives in your agent workspace, and you have to write it.

```bash
cp config/example-config.json ~/.openclaw/eve-dashboard-config.json
# edit it — use $ENV:VARIABLE_NAME for anything secret, never inline a token
python3 scripts/validate_config.py ~/.openclaw/eve-dashboard-config.json
```

Full schema in [config/schema.json](config/schema.json), endpoint presets in
[config/esi_endpoints.json](config/esi_endpoints.json).

| Alerts | | Reports | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `war_declared` | New war declaration | `net_worth` | ISK across wallet and assets |
| `structure_under_attack` | Structure attacked | `skill_queue` | Current training status |
| `skill_complete` | Skill finished training | `industry_jobs` | Active manufacturing and research |
| `wallet_large_deposit` | Deposit above a threshold | `market_orders` | Open buy and sell orders |
| `industry_job_complete` | Job done | `wallet_summary` | Recent transactions |
| `pi_extractor_expired` | Extraction head expired | `assets_summary` | Top asset locations by value |
| `killmail` | New killmail | | |
| `contract_expired` | Contract expired | | |

## Security

This skill holds credentials to your account. What that means concretely:

- Tokens live in `~/.openclaw/eve-tokens.json` with `chmod 600`. Refresh tokens
  rotate on every use, as EVE SSO intends.
- PKCE means there is no client secret to leak in the first place.
- **Access tokens expire in about 20 minutes. Refresh tokens do not.** Anything
  that prints a refresh token — logs, transcripts, CI output — hands over
  lasting access. `get_token.py --json` redacts it unless you explicitly pass
  `--include-refresh-token`.
- Prefer `--char`; it keeps the token out of `ps` output and shell history.
  Use `--token-stdin` when a token genuinely has to be handed over.
- `.gitignore` blocks `eve-tokens.json`, anything matching `*credentials*`, and
  the dashboard config. **Never commit real tokens.**
- Writes to your account are refused unless you pass `--allow-write`.

Access can be revoked at any time at
[EVE Third Party Applications](https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party/).

## Reference

### Scope profiles

Scopes are granted once at login and persist until the token is revoked, so the
login asks for a profile rather than for everything. **The default is `pi` with
8 scopes** — notably no wallet and no mail. All profiles build on `basic`, and
`full` contains every other one, but `pi` and `industry` are siblings: choosing
`industry` does *not* give you the PI scope.

```bash
python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --list-scope-profiles   # see exactly what each asks for
python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --client-id <ID> --char-name main --scope-profile full
```

| Profile | Scopes | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `basic` | 7 | skills, skill queue, clones, implants, location, ship, online status |
| `pi` *(default)* | 8 | `esi-planets.manage_planets.v1` |
| `industry` | 11 | assets, industry jobs, market orders, contracts |
| `full` | 17 | wallet, mail, notifications, killmails, jump fatigue |

`--scopes "<space-separated list>"` overrides the profile entirely. Before it
opens the browser, `auth_flow.py` prints the exact scope list it is about to
request.

> **`full` is not every scope ESI has.** It covers the 17 scopes the skill's own
> high-level features need. [`references/endpoints.md`](references/endpoints.md)
> documents 37 — the remaining 20 (contacts, fittings, mining, loyalty points,
> bookmarks, calendar, standings, blueprints, medals, titles, fleet, structure
> search, and the four `write_*`/`send_mail` ones) are in **no** profile.
> The raw endpoint mode can address those routes, but ESI will reject them with
> a missing-scope error unless you requested them explicitly and enabled them on
> your EVE application. The four write scopes are left out on purpose: this
> skill is read-only by default.
>
> To take a profile and add to it, pass the union yourself — `--scopes` replaces
> the profile rather than extending it:
>
> ```bash
> python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --list-scope-profiles      # copy the full list
> python3 scripts/auth_flow.py --client-id <ID> --char-name main \
>   --scopes "<the 17 from full> esi-fittings.read_fittings.v1 esi-industry.read_character_mining.v1"
> ```

> Despite its name, `esi-planets.manage_planets.v1` is the scope ESI requires
> for *reading* PI colony data; this skill never writes to a colony. The name is
> CCP's, and the real consent gate is the EVE SSO page, which shows you the same
> list before you approve it.

### ESI compliance

- No versioned URL prefixes. Requests go to `https://esi.evetech.net` and carry
  `X-Compatibility-Date: 2026-08-04`, per CCP's move away from `/latest` and
  `/v5`. Override with `--compatibility-date` or `EVE_ESI_COMPATIBILITY_DATE`.
- Every request — ESI and SSO alike — sends a `User-Agent` naming the skill,
  its version and this repository. Set `EVE_ESI_CONTACT` to add an email or
  `discord:name`.
- `429` responses are retried after `Retry-After`, `420` after the error-limit
  reset, three attempts at most. A rate limit bucket below 20% warns on stderr.
- The `Expires` header is surfaced rather than worked around.

### Action parameters

- `--action` accepts `pi_planets`, `pi_planet_detail`, `pi_status`,
  `market_price_bulk`, `jita_price`, `system_kills`, `system_jumps`,
  `system_info`, `route_plan`, `character_location`, `fw_systems`, `incursions`
- `--character-id` — required for PI actions and `character_location`
- `--planet-id` — required for `pi_planet_detail`
- `--type-id` — required for `jita_price`
- `--system-id` / `--system-ids` — threat actions
- `--origin`, `--destination`, `--route-flag` — `route_plan`

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+ — standard library only for core ESI queries
- OpenClaw gateway, for agent integration
- Redis and the `redis` package — **optional**, only for PI price caching

<details>
<summary>Optional: Redis price cache</summary>

Caches PI market prices with a one-hour TTL. Without it, prices are fetched
live from ESI on every request.

```bash
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
pip3 install redis
redis-cli ping   # → PONG
```

The companion script `cache_market_prices.py` does not exist yet — it is a
sketch of what you would write in your agent workspace, using the key schema
`eve:market:price:{type_id}`. Nothing in this repo reads or writes Redis.
